# Quote A Lang Server
A Node/Express API for quote-a-lang

Hello! Welcome to this repository!

This project is aimed for helping people learn new languages using quotes. It currently is powered by a Python web crawler which fetches data from WikiQuotes and adds it to the DB. 

We're looking for help in order to expand the number of languages supported by the app (currently, we're able to fetch only quotes in French), possibly implementing integrations for social networks and SRS systems, as well as (futurally) having our own approach to it.

The project's aimed to be opensource and we'll be accepting contributions in the future!

# Running the project

The project has currently a simple node env, we designed two scripts:

`npm run dev` - starts development environment, with hot-reloading

`Ç¹pm start` - starts the production server, without hot reloading...
